# Urban-Growth-Mapping
This project focuses on analyzing urban expansion patterns using multi-temporal satellite imagery and geospatial analysis techniques. The study assesses Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) changes between 2000 and 2024 to understand the spatial dynamics of urban growth.

Key components include:

-LULC classification using supervised techniques applied to Landsat imagery

-Change detection analysis to quantify transitions from vegetation, agricultural, or open land to built-up areas

-Use of QGIS for raster analytics, spatial statistics, and geospatial visualization

-Mapping and interpretation of urban sprawl trends to inform sustainable urban planning

The project highlights how remote sensing and GIS tools can support data-driven insights into land transformation, enabling better urban development policies and environmental impact assessments.
